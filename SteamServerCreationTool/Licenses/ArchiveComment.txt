Steam Server Creation Tool STCC - GPL-3.0 license

Steam Server Creation Tool is a simple GUI based server installation tool. It's an easy and quick tool to install and manage servers. 
It "automates" the usage of SteamCMD to install servers extrapolated from Steam's API. 
This application is designed around an "always up to date" idea and should work forever, even if steam adds/remove servers.
